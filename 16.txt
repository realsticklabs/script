A dimly lit TLC/LOL chamber, everyone is lounging, but something’s off.
Blocky

Alright, pranksters, today’s the day we double down on FreeSmart’s eternal enemy… Needles!

    Coiny

What’s wrong with Needles? They’re just shiny sticks!

    Blocky

No, no, not literal needles! Needle! You know… the contestant who keeps poking into our plans!

    Pencil

Yeah, yeah. But why mess with her now?

    Blocky

Because it’s going to make the elimination SO much better!

    Needle

Did somebody say my name?
Blocky

Uh, n-no, Needle! Just… just chatting about, uh, TLC renovations!

    Needle

Hmm... alright, but I’ll be watching you!
Blocky

Prank prep begins now.
BFDIA 14+ Cake at Stake theme plays and so does the intro.
Back at the elimination area, everyone gathers in a semicircle. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation.

    Bell

Welcome back, contestants! Today’s elimination is extra special! Why, you ask?
Tennis Ball

Because of the “likes” and “dislikes” vote? And, who gets the mystery prize?

    Cake

More like, who’s in for a VERY memorable surprise.

    Balloony

Let’s see… with the least dislikes and most likes, Tennis Ball, you win the mystery prize!

    Tennis Ball

Oh, my circuits and cables! What is it?

    Bell

This magical wrench will let you control the size of anything… use it wisely!

    Fries

Knowing TB, he’ll probably just shrink a math book.
Tennis Ball

Let’s get the results!

    Balloony

Here we go! The contestant with the most dislikes… (points dramatically) Bomby, with 14,372 dislikes!

    Bomby

WHAT?! What did I even do?

    Needle

Maybe it’s your explosive personality?

    Pin

Burn!

    Bomby

Fine! But I’m watching the whole mess from above!

    Needle

Whoa, one less teammate...
Contestants are gathered around an ancient-looking miniature colosseum with a small birdhouse in the center, ominously lit.

    Bell

Today’s challenge? You’ll enter the “Shrunken Colosseum” and retrieve the legendary Golden Feather hidden deep within. First team to return with the feather gets immunity!

    Book

Sounds easy enough! Let’s go, Stars!

    Tennis Ball

Oh, no, it’s not that easy, Book. The birdhouse… shrinks you!

    Fries

Great. Just what we need, a super tiny TB running around.

    Bell

Teams, prepare! You’ll enter in sets of two to navigate the maze, solve puzzles, and face... whatever’s lurking inside.
The first teams, Pencil and Coiny, Book and Pin, Needle and Nickel, and Tennis Ball and Fries, are shrunk and enter the colosseum maze.

    Pencil

Why is everything so dusty? It’s like no one’s cleaned here for centuries!

    Coiny

You’re a pencil. Just... draw a map or something.

    Pencil

Don’t you know anything about stationery?

    Nickel

Shh, I hear… something…
A loud buzzing echoes through the maze. Suddenly, a swarm of tiny mechanical bugs floods in.

    Pin

AHHH! Insects! Get them away!

    Book

Pin, stay calm! (opens her pages) I’ll consult my entomology section! Okay, we’re dealing with metal beetles, weak against magnets.

    Needle

Got one right here. (flings her metal arm at a bug, which short-circuits on contact)

    Nickel

Hey, Needle, I thought you were done with the whole “hero act.”

    Needle

Today’s different.
Further in the maze, TB and Fries encounter a “Shrink Shrinker”, a device that makes them even tinier, giving them only 10 minutes before they’re too small to be detected.

    Fries

Great! We’re going from small to microscopic! Why did I even join this team?

    Tennis Ball

Just... think positive, okay? I’ve got a plan.

    Fries

And what is it?

    Tennis Ball

Science. Let’s go!
TB constructs a makeshift “de-shrinker” by rerouting the shrinker’s controls, allowing them to stabilize their size temporarily.

    Needle

You call that a science trick? I can do better.

    Tennis Ball

I’d like to see you try.

    Pin and Book
That doesn’t sound good…
They arrive to find a massive, guardian beetle protecting the Golden Feather.

    Pin

It’s HUGE!

    Book

Hold on… “Golden Beetles hate bright light!” Does anyone have…?

    Pencil

Right here!
Pin and Book manage to distract the beetle with the mirror, allowing Needle to sneak past and grab the feather.

    Coiny

Finally! We’re gonna win!
But suddenly, a trap door opens beneath them, and everyone begins falling down a massive chute leading out of the maze.
Stinger: A quiet room where the feather rests on a stand. Suddenly, a faint rustling sound echoes, and a shadow appears over the feather.


    Bomby

You really thought I’d go out that easily?
The shadow reaches for the feather, and the screen fades to black.
